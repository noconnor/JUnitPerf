# JUnitPerf [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noconnor/JUnitPerf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noconnor/JUnitPerf)


API performance testing framework built using JUnit

JUnitPerf provides an extension to the JUnit4 framework, allowing unittests to be extended to operate as 
performance evaluation tests. 

Using a custom [Junit Rule](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules) and by 
applying custom java annotations to a basic unittests, it is possible to execute this annotated test multiple times 
while gathering statistical information. 

This library interface was heavily influenced by the interface in the deprecated 
[Contiperf library](https://github.com/lucaspouzac/contiperf) developed by [Lucas Pouzac](https://github.com/lucaspouzac)

## Usage Instructions

Add the JUnitPerf Rule to your test class

```
@Rule
public JUnitPerfRule perfTestRule = new JUnitPerfRule();
```

Next add the `JUnitPerfTest` annotation to the unit test you would like to translate into performance test  

```
@Test
@JUnitPerfTest(threads = 50, duration = 125_000, warmUp = 10_000, rateLimit = 11_000)
public void whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash(){
  ... EXECUTE TIME SENSITIVE TASK ...
}
``` 

In the example above, the unittest `whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash` will be executed in a loop for 
125 secs (125,000ms) using 50 threads. 

The executions will be rate limited to 11K loops executions per second. 

No statistical data will be captured during the warm up period (10 seconds - 10,000ms) 

Optionally add the performance test requirements annotation (`JUnitPerfTestRequirement`) to your performance test. 
These requirements will be applied to the statistics gathered during the performance test execution. 
If thresholds are not met, test will fail.


```
@Test
@JUnitPerfTest(threads = 50, duration = 125_000, warmUp = 10_000, rateLimit = 11_000)
@JUnitPerfTestRequirement(percentiles = "90:7,95:7,98:7,99:8", throughput = 10_000, allowedErrorsRate = 0.10)
public void whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash(){
  ... EXECUTE TIME SENSITIVE TASK ...
}
``` 

In the example above, the `JUnitPerfTestRequirement` annotation applied a number of threshold constraints to the performance test
The tests calculated throughput (executions per second) will be compared to the `throughput` requirement. 
If the test throughput is *less* than the target throughput then the test will fail.

This test also contained a requirement that the execution error rate be no more than 10% (`allowedErrorsRate = 0.10`). 
An error is an uncaught exception thrown during unittest execution. 
If the specified `allowedErrorsRate` is not met then the test will fail.

Finally the example set a number of latency thresholds on the 90th, 95th, 98th and 99th percentiles (i.e. if the 
99th percentile latency is greater than 8ms then the test will fail). 
The latency is a measurement of the time taken to execute one loop (not including statistics measurement calculations) 

More information on statistic calculations can be found [here](Statistics)

`@JUnitPerfTest` has the following configuration parameters:

* error percentage (exceptional test executions as a percentage of successful test executions)

## Build Instructions

**Intellij 14 Setup**

To run/add to this project using intellij you will require the following plugins:

* [Lombok](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317)
* CodeStyle Formatter
<br />
To configure your IntelliJ settings to use this formatter:
    * IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Editor > Code Style > Scheme > Project (Apply Settings)

To resolve issues with lombok annotations not being compiled during a module make try setting the following preference:

* Go to the preferences (settings) menu
* Search for the "Compiler" section in the dialog window and then go to the "Annotation Processors" subsection
* Tick the checkbox reading "Enable annotation processing"
