# JUnitPerf [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noconnor/JUnitPerf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noconnor/JUnitPerf)


API performance testing framework built using JUnit

JUnitPerf provides an extension to the JUnit4 framework, allowing unittests to be extended to operate as 
performance evaluation tests. 

Using a custom [Junit Rule](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules) and by 
applying custom java annotations to a basic unittests, it is possible to execute this annotated test multiple times 
while gathering statistical information. 

This library interface was heavily influenced by the interface in the deprecated 
[Contiperf library](https://github.com/lucaspouzac/contiperf) developed by [Lucas Pouzac](https://github.com/lucaspouzac)

## Install Instructions 

`JUnitPerf` is available in [maven central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.noconnor%22)

To add `JunitPerf` to your gradle project add the following line to your build.gradle files dependencies:

`compile 'com.github.noconnor:junitperf:VERSION'`

Replacing `VERSION` with the latest release available in maven
 

## Usage Instructions

This section contains usage details for the `JUnitPerf` library. To see example test cases browse to the [src/test/examples/](src/test/examples/) folder. 

Add the JUnitPerf Rule to your test class

```
@Rule
public JUnitPerfRule perfTestRule = new JUnitPerfRule();
```

Next add the `JUnitPerfTest` annotation to the unit test you would like to translate into performance test  

```
@Test
@JUnitPerfTest(threads = 50, duration = 125_000, warmUp = 10_000, rateLimit = 11_000)
public void whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash(){
  ... EXECUTE TIME SENSITIVE TASK ...
}
``` 

In the example above, the unittest `whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash` will be executed in a loop for 
125 secs (125,000ms) using 50 threads. 

The executions will be rate limited to 11K loops executions per second. 

No statistical data will be captured during the warm up period (10 seconds - 10,000ms) 

Optionally add the performance test requirements annotation (`JUnitPerfTestRequirement`) to your performance test. 
These requirements will be applied to the statistics gathered during the performance test execution. 
If thresholds are not met, test will fail.


```
@Test
@JUnitPerfTest(threads = 50, duration = 125_000, warmUp = 10_000, rateLimit = 11_000)
@JUnitPerfTestRequirement(percentiles = "90:7,95:7,98:7,99:8", throughput = 10_000, allowedErrorsRate = 0.10)
public void whenExecuting11Kqps_thenApiShouldNotCrash(){
  ... EXECUTE TIME SENSITIVE TASK ...
}
``` 

In the example above, the `JUnitPerfTestRequirement` annotation applied a number of threshold constraints to the performance test
The tests calculated throughput (executions per second) will be compared to the `throughput` requirement. 
If the test throughput is *less* than the target throughput then the test will fail.

This test also contained a requirement that the execution error rate be no more than 10% (`allowedErrorsRate = 0.10`). 
An error is an uncaught exception thrown during unittest execution. 
If the specified `allowedErrorsRate` is not met then the test will fail.

Finally the example set a number of latency thresholds on the 90th, 95th, 98th and 99th percentiles (i.e. if the 
99th percentile latency is greater than 8ms then the test will fail). 
The latency is a measurement of the time taken to execute one loop (not including statistics measurement calculations) 

More information on statistic calculations can be found [here](Statistics)

`@JUnitPerfTest` has the following configuration parameters:

| Property      | Definition                                                                                                                  | Default value  |
| ------------: |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| --------------:|
| threads       | The total number of threads to use during test execution                                                                    |        1       |
| duration      | Total time to run test in millisecs (ms) (incl warmup period)                                                               |      60,000    |
| warmUp        | Warm up period in ms, test will be executed during warm up, but results will not be considered during statistics evaluation |        0       |
| rateLimit     | Sets the maximum number of iteration per second (disabled by default)                                                       |       -1       |



`@JUnitPerfTestRequirement` has the following configuration parameters:

| Property          | Definition                                                                                                                  | Default value  |

| allowedErrorsRate | Allowed % of errors (uncaught exceptions) during test execution (value between 0 and 1, where 1 = 100% errors allowed)      |        1       |


## Reports

**HTML Reports**

By default, the JUnitPerf library will generate a HTML performance report under `${BUILD_DIR}/reports/junitperf_report.html`

An example report can be seen below

![HTML Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noconnor/JUnitPerf/master/src/common/images/example_report.png "Example JUnitPerf html report")

Hovering over the datapoints on the percentile latency graph will provide latency/percentile information. 
It is possible to override the default output path by constructing the `JUnitPerfRule` in the following way:
```
@Rule
public JUnitPerfRule perfTestRule = new JUnitPerfRule(new HtmlReportGenerator("/some/custom/path/report.html"));
```

HTML reports are generated using the [jtwig library](http://jtwig.org/). The jtwig report template can be found under `src/main/resources/templates/report.twig`.
It is possible to override this template by placing a customised `templates/report.twig` file on the classpath ahead of the default template.


**Console Reporting**

It is also possible to use use a build in console reporter. To change from the default HTML reporter to the console report
just create an instance of the `ConsoleReportGenerator` class and pass a reference to this class to the `JUnitPerfRule` constructor, 
for example: 
```
@Rule
public JUnitPerfRule perfTestRule = new JUnitPerfRule(new ConsoleReportGenerator());
```

**Custom Reporting**

If further customisation is required, a custom implementation of the `ReportGenerator` interface can be passed to the the `JunitPerRule` constructor



## Statistics

By default, statistics are captured and calculated using the apache [Descriptive Statistics library](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html#a1.2_Descriptive_statistics).
See [DescriptiveStatisticsCalculator](src/main/com/github/noconnor/junitperf/statistics/providers/DescriptiveStatisticsCalculator) for more details.

To override the default statistics calculation class a custom implementation of the `StatisticsCalculator` interface can 
be passed to the `JUnitPerfRule` constructor

```
@Rule
public JUnitPerfRule perfTestRule = new JUnitPerfRule(new CustomStatisticsCalculatorImpl());
```
